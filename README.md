This is the second course assignment of data engineering, which is about pandas descriptive statistics script.
There are four requirements of this assignment: Python script using Pandas for descriptive statistics, read a dataset (CSV or Excel), generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation), create at least one data visualizatio. The dataset I chose is 'Project-Management-Sample-Data.xlsx'.
